## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a good review of basic HTML and CSS flexbox with responsive mobile design in mind. 

### Continuing development

Keeping accessibility in mind throughout my work flow in each project.
- alt attributes for all img tags with alternative text describing the image
- using HTML landmarks for users using screen readers 
    <header>
    <nav>
    <main>
    <aside>
    <section>
    <footer>
